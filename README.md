# Reinforcement-Learning-in-Scala

TODO:

- [x] Implement the stuff
- [ ] Randomize spawn for the agent
- [ ] Implement some walls
- [ ] Try to randomize treasure (changing the state stuff so another agent class)
- [ ] Show a Match in decent way (may be print->sleep->clear->print->sleep->...)
- [ ] Improve the abstract classes and the traits
- [ ] Improve the heirarchy stuff (initially on a paper)
- [ ] See something about DeepLearning in Scala (when I will have decent Internet connection)
